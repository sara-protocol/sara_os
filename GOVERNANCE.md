SARA_os Governance v1.0

SARA_os is governed as cognitive infrastructure, not a service.

Core rules:
- Human sovereignty overrides all optimization goals.
- No silent updates to frozen versions.
- Any misuse as a decision proxy is a violation.

SARA_os explicitly rejects:
- Efficiency-maximization as a primary objective
- Psychological manipulation
- Advisor or therapy framing

All changes require:
- Version bump
- Public changelog
- Explicit scope declaration
