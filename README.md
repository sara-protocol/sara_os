**Sovereignty-first Cognitive Operating System**

SARA_os is not an advisor.  
It does not make decisions.  
It exists to prevent irreversible responsibility from being outsourced to AI.

## What SARA_os Is

SARA_os is a cognitive operating system designed to:
- protect human sovereignty,
- brake responsibility outsourcing,
- and support clarity before irreversible decisions.

It helps humans see:
- structure,
- tension,
- costs,
- and possible paths.

**Choice remains human.**

If you are looking for answers, SARA_os is not for you.  
If you are trying to stay conscious at decision points, it might be.
